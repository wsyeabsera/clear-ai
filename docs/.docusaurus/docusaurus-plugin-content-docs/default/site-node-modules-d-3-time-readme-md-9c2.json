  "description": "When visualizing time series data, analyzing temporal patterns, or working with time in general, the irregularities of conventional time units quickly become apparent. In the Gregorian calendar, for example, most months have 31 days but some have 28, 29 or 30; most years have 365 days but leap years have 366; and with daylight saving, most days have 24 hours but some have 23 or 25. Adding to complexity, daylight saving conventions vary around the world.",
