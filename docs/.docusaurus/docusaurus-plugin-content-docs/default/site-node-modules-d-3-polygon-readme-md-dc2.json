  "description": "This module provides a few basic geometric operations for two-dimensional polygons. Each polygon is represented as an array of two-element arrays [​[x1, y1], [x2, y2], …], and may either be closed (wherein the first and last point are the same) or open (wherein they are not). Typically polygons are in counterclockwise order, assuming a coordinate system where the origin ⟨0,0⟩ is in the top-left corner.",
