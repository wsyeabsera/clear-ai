  "description": "Panning and zooming are popular interaction techniques which let the user focus on a region of interest by restricting the view. It is easy to learn due to direct manipulation: click-and-drag to pan (translate), spin the wheel to zoom (scale), or use touch. Panning and zooming are widely used in web-based mapping, but can also be used with visualizations such as time-series and scatterplots.",
