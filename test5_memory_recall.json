You have also shown curiosity about web development and artificial intelligence. For someone with your preferences, I would recommend focusing on expanding your knowledge in these areas through practice, online tutorials, and maybe even considering taking advanced courses or certifications to enhance your skills further.\n\nIf you're interested in web development, you could explore frameworks like Django or React to deepen your understanding of full-stack development. For artificial intelligence, diving into machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or scikit-learn can be a great way to apply your programming skills to this field.\n\nRemember to keep practicing regularly, work on projects that interest you, and stay updated with the latest trends in the programming world to continue growing as a programmer.
