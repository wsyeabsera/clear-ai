Timestamp: \"2025-10-03T10:00:48.959Z\"\n\nNow, let's look at the relationships between different data elements:\n- Temperature and \"Feels Like\" temperature are the same in this case, indicating that the perceived temperature matches the actual temperature.\n- The wind speed and wind direction provide information about the current wind conditions in New York.\n- Visibility of 16 km suggests good visibility in the area.\n- The timestamp indicates the date and time when the weather data was retrieved.\n\nIn terms of data organization, we can see a hierarchical structure where each data point is related to the overall weather conditions in New York at a specific time. The data elements such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc., are all interconnected and provide a comprehensive overview of the weather situation.\n\nOverall, the API response is well-structured, providing detailed information about the current weather in New York, with each data point playing a specific role in describing the weather conditions accurately.","intent":{"type":"tool_execution","confidence":1,"requiredTools":["weather_api"],"memoryContext":false,"reasoning":"The user is requesting the current weather information for a specific location, which requires the 'weather_api' tool for weather data retrieval."},"toolResults":[{"success":true,"toolName":"weather_api","result":{"city":"New York","country":"United States of America","temperature":14,"feelsLike":14,"humidity":60,"pressure":1032,"description":"Clear","windSpeed":2.222224,"windDirection":215,"visibility":16,"timestamp":"2025-10-03T10:00:48.959Z"},"executionTime":0}],"reasoning":"Intent: tool_execution (confidence: 1) | Reasoning: The user is requesting the current weather information for a specific location, which requires the 'weather_api' tool for weather data retrieval. | Tools executed: weather_api","advancedReasoning":{"intent":{"type":"tool_execution","confidence":1,"requiredTools":["weather_api"],"memoryContext":false,"reasoning":"The user is requesting the current weather for a specific location, New York.
